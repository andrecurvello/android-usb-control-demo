In onCreate:

  ControllerOutputUSB controllerOutputUSB = new ControllerOutputUSB(this); 
  controllerOutputUSB.tryUseAccessoryFromIntent(getIntent());


To send data to the Arduino board:

  // sets channel 1 to 75% of the full range, channel 2 to 40% of the full range (range being -1 ... 1)
  controllerOutputUSB.controlMotion(0.5, -0.2);
